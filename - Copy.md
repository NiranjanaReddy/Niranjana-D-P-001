## TASK 1: 3D PRINTING
Through this task, I learned the fundamentals of 3D printing, including how the printer operates and the purpose of STL files in defining 3D object geometry. I understood how to use **Creality Slicer** to convert STL files into G-code for printing. Additionally, I explored critical printer settings such as **bed temperature, infill density, nozzle temperature**, and their impact on the print's quality, especially when using PLA material. By studying the SOPs, I learned how to safely and efficiently operate the 3D printer. Finally, by slicing and printing an STL file, I gained hands-on experience with the entire 3D printing workflow, from preparation to printing.

## TASK 16: DATASHEETS REPORT WRITING
The **L293D** is a dual-channel H-bridge motor driver IC, capable of controlling two DC motors independently or one stepper motor. Each channel operates as a full H-bridge, allowing motors to run forward, backward, or stop. It supports a variety of loads such as 4 uni-directional DC motors, 2 bi-directional DC motors, 1 stepper motor, solenoids, or inductive loads.  
![Image](https://github.com/NiranjanaReddy/Niranjana-D-P-001/blob/main/L293D1.png)  

To protect the IC and the circuit from voltage spikes generated when the motor is de-energized, the **L293D** includes internal kick-back diodes. It operates with motor supply voltages between **4.5V and 36V**, making it compatible with most DC motors. It provides up to **1.2A peak current per channel** and **600mA continuous current**, sufficient for driving small and medium-sized motors.

**Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** is a highly efficient method used to control the speed of DC motors by varying the average voltage delivered to the motor. Instead of supplying a constant voltage, PWM rapidly switches the power on and off, creating pulses. The ratio of the "on" time to the total cycle time, known as the duty cycle, determines the effective voltage. A higher duty cycle results in a faster motor speed, while a lower duty cycle slows it down. The frequency of the PWM signal ensures smooth operation without noticeable jerks.

An **H-Bridge** is an electronic circuit used to control the direction of rotation of a DC motor. It consists of four switches, typically transistors or MOSFETs, arranged in an "H" configuration. By selectively closing these switches, the current can flow through the motor in either direction, enabling forward or reverse rotation. For example, activating one diagonal pair of switches drives the motor forward, while activating the opposite diagonal pair reverses its direction. Turning off all switches stops the motor, and activating both switches on the same side can apply a braking effect.

## TASK 17: INTRODUCTION TO VR
### Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)

#### Virtual Reality (VR)
Virtual Reality is the simulation experience that lets people interact with a computer-generated environment. This experience occurs through immersive hardware in which head-mounted displays (HMDs), gloves, or motion trackers are used. With VR, the surroundings are completely replaced by a virtual world to create an enhanced sensory-rich experience commonly utilized for gaming, training, healthcare, and entertainment purposes.

**Important Characteristics of VR:**
- It allows users to be fully transported to a virtual environment.
- It makes interactive operation with the virtual environment through motion-tracking devices.
- It completely uses the computer-generated environment and does not have real-world content.

#### Augmented Reality (AR)
Augmented Reality (AR) overlays digital information and virtual objects onto the real world. Unlike VR, AR enhances the physical world by superimposing computer-generated visuals, sounds, or other sensory data through devices such as smartphones, AR glasses, or tablets.

**Important Characteristics of AR:**
- Integrates real-world and digital elements.
- Enhances the existing environment rather than replacing it.
- It is widely used in retail, education, healthcare, navigation, and industrial training.

#### Difference Between VR and AR

|-------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Environment       | Fully synthetic, replaces the real world | Real-world environment enhanced digitally |
| Immersion         | High – Users are fully immersed          | Partial – Users remain in their real environment |
| Hardware          | Requires HMDs, gloves, motion trackers   | Requires smartphones, AR glasses, or tablets |
| Applications      | Gaming, training simulations, therapy    | Retail, real estate, healthcare, education |
| Interaction       | Fully interactive in virtual space       | Interaction with virtual objects in real-world locations |

#### Current Trends for VR and AR
1. **MR Evolution - Mixed Reality**: AR or VR combined to provide more hybrid environments with perfect interactions between physical and virtual interfaces.

#### Conclusion
Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality represent the next frontier in how we interact with digital content and environments. While VR takes users to entirely virtual spaces, AR enhances their physical surroundings by adding digital overlays. The rapid development of hardware, software, and connectivity ensures that both technologies are ready to transform industries such as gaming, healthcare, education, and retail. In India, companies are leveraging these technologies to create innovative solutions that cater to local and global markets, signifying the country's growing role in this dynamic field.
